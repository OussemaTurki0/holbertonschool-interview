# Sorted Array to AVL Tree

This project implements a function that builds an AVL tree from a **sorted array**.

## Description

Given a sorted array of integers (with no duplicate values), the function constructs a height-balanced AVL Tree **without any rotations**. The tree is balanced by always inserting the middle element as the root or subtree root during recursive calls.
