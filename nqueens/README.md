The N Queens Problem is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N Ã— N chessboard. This means that no two queens should be able to attack each other. A queen in chess can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Therefore, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project is a Python script that solves the N Queens Problem and prints all possible solutions for a given N.
