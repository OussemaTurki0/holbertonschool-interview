# Heap Sort

This directory implements the **heap sort** algorithm in C, using the sift-down (max-heap) approach. It prints the array after every swap, so you can see the heap operations step by step.

## Files

- **sort.h**  
  Prototype declarations and include guard for `heap_sort` and `print_array`.

- **0-heap_sort.c**  
  Your implementation of `heap_sort(int *array, size_t size)` plus a `sift_down` helper.

- **0-O**  
  Big-O time complexity for heap sort
